    "- **Extracting Methods**: Breaking down the function into smaller, reusable functions.\n",
    "- **Removing Duplication**: Consolidating repetitive logic.\n",
    "- **Simplifying Conditionals**: Making conditional statements more readable.\n",
    "- **Using Constants**: Replacing magic numbers with named constants for clarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation of the Refactored Code:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Constants Defined**:\n",
    "   - `DISCOUNT_RATE`: Represents the discount percentage, replacing the magic number `0.1`.\n",
    "   - `HIGH_INCOME_THRESHOLD`: Defines the income threshold for applying discounts, replacing the magic number `1000`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Main Function (`process_user`)**:\n",
    "   - **Single Responsibility**: Now only orchestrates the processing by calling other functions.\n",
    "   - **Early Exit**: If the user is inactive, the function exits early, enhancing readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Helper Function (`is_user_active`)**:\n",
    "   - **Descriptive Naming**: Clearly indicates its purpose.\n",
    "   - **Consolidated Logic**: Checks if the user's role is in the list of active roles and if the user is active.\n",
    "   - **Reusability**: Can be reused for other user status checks if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Helper Function (`apply_discount_if_applicable`)**:\n",
    "   - **Encapsulated Logic**: Handles discount calculation based on income.\n",
    "   - **No Duplication**: The discount logic is centralized, eliminating repetition.\n",
    "   - **State Modification**: Updates the `user` dictionary with the calculated discount.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Helper Function (`calculate_total_amount`)**:\n",
    "   - **Clear Purpose**: Calculates and prints the total amount.\n",
    "   - **Separation of Concerns**: Keeps calculation logic separate from validation and discount application.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Improved Readability and Maintainability**:\n",
    "   - The refactored code is easier to read, understand, and maintain.\n",
    "   - Each function has a clear, singular purpose, adhering to best practices.\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Benefits of Refactoring Applied**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Enhanced Readability**: Clear and descriptive names make the code self-explanatory.\n",
    "2. **Improved Maintainability**: Smaller functions are easier to manage and test.\n",
    "3. **Reduced Duplication**: Centralizing repeated logic minimizes errors and simplifies updates.\n",
    "4. **Better Performance**: While not a primary focus here, cleaner code can lead to performance optimizations.\n",
    "5. **Scalability**: The modular structure allows for easier addition of new features or modifications."

    "### Original Code Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "The original code snippet is designed to find all prime numbers up to a specified limit (in this case, 10,000). It includes a function to determine if a number is prime and another function to collect all prime numbers within the given range. Here’s a breakdown of its functionality:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Function Purpose**:\n",
    "The main purpose of this code is to identify and count the total number of prime numbers within a specified limit, while also measuring the execution time of the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Functionality Breakdown**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`is_prime(n)`**:\n",
    "   - This function checks whether a given number `n` is a prime number. It returns `True` if `n` is prime and `False` otherwise.\n",
    "   - **Logic**:\n",
    "     - It first checks if `n` is less than or equal to 1, in which case it cannot be prime.\n",
    "     - It then iterates from `2` to `n-1`, checking if `n` is divisible by any of these numbers. If it finds a divisor, it concludes that `n` is not prime.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Example**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def is_prime(n):\n",
    "       if n <= 1:\n",
    "           return False\n",
    "       for i in range(2, n):\n",
    "           if n % i == 0:\n",
    "               return False\n",
    "       return True\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`find_primes_original(limit)`**:\n",
    "   - This function generates a list of all prime numbers up to the specified `limit`.\n",
    "   - **Logic**:\n",
    "     - It initializes an empty list called `primes`.\n",
    "     - It then iterates over every number from `0` to `limit - 1`, checking if each number is prime using the `is_prime` function. If a number is found to be prime, it is appended to the `primes` list.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Example**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def find_primes_original(limit):\n",
    "       primes = []\n",
    "       for number in range(limit):\n",
    "           if is_prime(number):\n",
    "               primes.append(number)\n",
    "       return primes\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Execution Timing**:\n",
    "   - The code measures the execution time of the `find_primes_original` function by capturing the start time before execution and the end time afterward. The difference gives the total time taken to find the prime numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Example**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   start_time = time.time()\n",
    "   primes_original = find_primes_original(10000)\n",
    "   end_time = time.time()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Output**:\n",
    "   - Finally, it prints the total number of prime numbers found and the execution time taken to perform the computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Example**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   print(f\"Original Total Prime Numbers: {len(primes_original)}\")\n",
    "   print(f\"Execution Time (Original): {end_time - start_time:.6f} seconds\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Issues Identified**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Inefficient Prime Checking**:\n",
    "   - The `is_prime` function uses a naive approach to check for primality, iterating through all numbers from `2` to `n-1`. This results in a time complexity of O(n) for each prime check. When combined with the loop in `find_primes_original`, it leads to an overall time complexity of O(n^2) for finding all primes up to `limit`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Recommendation**: Implement a more efficient algorithm, such as the Sieve of Eratosthenes, to reduce the time complexity to O(n log log n).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Redundant Range in Prime Check**:\n",
    "   - The check in `is_prime` can be optimized to iterate only up to the square root of `n` instead of `n-1`, as any non-prime number must have at least one factor less than or equal to its square root.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Recommendation**: Change the loop condition in `is_prime` to iterate from `2` to `int(n**0.5) + 1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Poor Naming Conventions**:\n",
    "   - The function names and variable names could be more descriptive. For instance, `find_primes_original` could be renamed to `find_primes_up_to_limit` to clearly indicate its purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Recommendation**: Improve naming conventions to enhance code readability and understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Magic Number**:\n",
    "   - The number `10000` is hard-coded in the execution block without context, which makes the code less flexible.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Recommendation**: Define a constant or allow user input for the limit, improving the code's adaptability for different use cases.\n",
    "   \n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Code Logic Efficiency**\n",
    "   - **Inefficient Prime Checking**:\n",
    "     - The `is_prime(n)` function employs a naive algorithm to check if a number is prime. It iterates through all integers from `2` to `n-1` to find divisors. This results in a time complexity of O(n) for each individual prime check.\n",
    "     - Since `find_primes_original(limit)` calls `is_prime(n)` for each number up to `limit`, the combined time complexity becomes O(n^2). This is particularly inefficient for larger values of `limit`, such as 10,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Recommendation**: \n",
    "     - Implement a more efficient algorithm, such as the **Sieve of Eratosthenes**. This method can find all prime numbers up to a specified limit with a time complexity of O(n log log n), significantly improving performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Code Logic Optimization**\n",
    "   - **Redundant Range in Prime Check**:\n",
    "     - The current implementation of the `is_prime(n)` function checks divisibility from `2` to `n-1`. However, if a number is not prime, it must have at least one factor less than or equal to its square root. \n",
    "     - By iterating only up to the square root of `n`, the number of checks can be reduced, leading to better performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Recommendation**: \n",
    "     - Modify the loop condition in `is_prime` to iterate from `2` to `int(n**0.5) + 1`, thus optimizing the primality check.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Code Quality and Readability**\n",
    "   - **Naming Conventions**:\n",
    "     - The function and variable names in the code could be more descriptive. For example, `find_primes_original` does not clearly communicate its purpose. Names should indicate functionality and intent for better understanding and maintainability.\n",
    "     - Poor naming conventions can lead to confusion, especially for new developers or when revisiting the code after some time.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Recommendation**: \n",
    "     - Rename `find_primes_original` to something more descriptive, like `find_primes_up_to_limit`, to clearly convey its function. Similarly, consider renaming variables for improved clarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Magic Numbers**\n",
    "   - **Hard-Coded Values**:\n",
    "     - The value `10,000` is hard-coded in the execution block without any context or explanation. This practice, known as using a \"magic number,\" reduces code flexibility and adaptability.\n",
    "     - When the limit is hard-coded, it limits the function's usability and may lead to errors if the value needs to be changed in multiple places.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Recommendation**: \n",
    "     - Define a constant or allow user input for the limit. For example, you could define `LIMIT = 10000` at the beginning of the script. This not only enhances readability but also allows for easy adjustments in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Execution Timing Clarity**\n",
    "   - **Lack of Context for Execution Timing**:\n",
    "     - While the code measures execution time, it does not provide context or comments explaining why timing is being measured. This can be confusing for someone who is reviewing the code.\n",
    "     - Additionally, the timing information could be more informative if presented in a more user-friendly format or combined with a message indicating the purpose of the calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Recommendation**: \n",
    "     - Add comments explaining the importance of measuring execution time and consider formatting the output to make it clearer. For instance, printing a message that summarizes the total number of prime numbers found alongside the execution time can provide a clearer context for the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Documentation and Comments**\n",
    "   - **Insufficient Documentation**:\n",
    "     - The code lacks adequate comments explaining the purpose of functions and key logic. Good documentation helps future maintainers understand the thought process behind the implementation, making the codebase more accessible.\n",
    "  \n",
    "   - **Recommendation**: \n",
    "     - Add docstrings to functions and comments within the code to explain the purpose of key sections. For example, a docstring for the `is_prime(n)` function could explain its input, output, and the logic used for determining primality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "By addressing these issues, the code can be made more efficient, maintainable, and understandable. Optimizing the algorithm for checking prime numbers, improving naming conventions, eliminating magic numbers, providing clearer execution timing context, and enhancing documentation will collectively lead to a better quality codebase."

    "   - The original `is_prime(n)` function checks all numbers from `2` to `n-1`, resulting in **O(n)** time complexity per check.\n",
    "   - The refactored function reduces this by:\n",
    "     - Eliminating even numbers and multiples of 3 upfront.\n",
    "     - Only checking factors up to the square root of `n` (`i * i <= n`), which reduces the number of iterations significantly.\n",
    "     - Using the `6k ± 1` pattern to skip unnecessary checks, further optimizing the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Time Complexity**:\n",
    "   - **Original Approach**: **O(n²)** overall for finding all primes up to `limit` (since each prime check is **O(n)** and you perform it **n** times).\n",
    "   - **Refactored Approach**: **O(n * sqrt(n))** overall for finding all primes up to `limit`, which is a substantial improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Visual Flowchart**\n",
    "\n",
    "To further clarify, here's a simplified flowchart of how `is_prime_refactored(n)` works:\n",

    "1. **Start**\n",
    "2. **Is `n <= 1`?**\n",
    "   - **Yes** → Not prime (`False`)\n",

    "  - **Efficient** as it significantly reduces the number of checks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example**: Checking `n = 29`\n",
    "  - Initial checks pass (`n > 3`, not divisible by `2` or `3`).\n",
    "  - Checks `i = 5` and `i + 2 = 7` → Neither divides `29`.\n",
    "  - Increments `i` to `11`; since `11 * 11 > 29`, stops.\n",

    "\n",
    "The `is_prime_refactored(n)` function enhances efficiency through:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Early Elimination**: Quickly rules out non-prime numbers by checking divisibility by 2 and 3.\n",
    "2. **Optimized Iteration**: Only checks potential factors up to the square root of `n` and leverages the `6k ± 1` pattern to minimize unnecessary checks.\n",
    "3. **Reduced Complexity**: Decreases the number of iterations from **O(n)** to approximately **O(√n)** per prime check, leading to significant performance gains, especially for large numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "By implementing these optimizations, the refactored function ensures faster execution while maintaining accurate prime detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`find_primes_refactored(limit)`**:\n",
    "   - This function generates a list of all prime numbers up to the specified `limit`.\n",
    "   - **Logic**:\n",
    "     - Similar to the original function, it initializes an empty list called `primes`.\n",
    "     - It iterates through every number from `0` to `limit - 1`, checking if each number is prime using the `is_prime_refactored` function. If a number is found to be prime, it is appended to the `primes` list.\n",

    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Execution Timing**:\n",
    "   - Similar to the original code, it measures the execution time of the `find_primes_refactored` function by capturing the start time before execution and the end time afterward. The difference provides the total time taken to find the prime numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Example**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   start_time = time.time()\n",

    "   end_time = time.time()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Output**:\n",
    "   - Finally, the code prints the total number of prime numbers found and the execution time taken to perform the computation.\n",

    "### **Improvements Made**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Optimized Prime Checking**:\n",
    "   - The `is_prime_refactored` function utilizes an optimized approach to check for primality, significantly reducing the number of iterations needed for larger numbers compared to the original implementation. The use of the `6k ± 1` rule further improves efficiency.\n",

    "   **Performance Impact**: This results in a time complexity of O(√n) for checking each prime, leading to a substantial overall performance improvement when finding primes up to `limit`.\n",

    "- **Execution Time**: Approximately **0.377 seconds**.\n",
    "- **Structure**: The code directly checks each number for primality using the `prime_check` function within a loop, resulting in multiple calls for each number up to the limit.\n",
    "- **Complexity**: The `prime_check` function uses an inefficient approach that checks every integer from `2` to `n-1`, resulting in a time complexity of **O(n^2)** overall. This is because for each number checked, it requires `n` iterations to confirm its primality.\n",

    "#### Refactored Code\n",
    "- **Execution Time**: **0.007844 seconds**, indicating a significant reduction in execution time.\n",
    "- **Modular Approach**: The refactored code separates concerns more effectively, using functions like `is_prime_refactored` to encapsulate the logic for checking primality. This enhances readability and makes it easier to maintain.\n",
    "- **Optimized Logic**: The `is_prime_refactored` function implements a more efficient algorithm, reducing unnecessary checks:\n",

    "### Code Quality\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Naming Conventions\n",
    "- **Original Code**:\n",
    "  - The variable names like `result`, `start_t`, and `end_t` lack clarity and do not convey their purpose effectively.\n",
    "  - Function names like `prime_check` and `get_primes` are functional but could benefit from more descriptive names that clarify their roles.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Refactored Code**:\n",
    "  - Improved naming conventions such as `is_prime_refactored` and `find_primes_refactored` provide better context about the functionality of each function.\n",
    "  - Clearer variable names like `primes` help indicate that the variable stores prime numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Code Logic\n",
    "- **Original Code**:\n",
    "  - The primality check involves unnecessary iterations, making it less efficient. The approach of iterating up to `n-1` is not optimal.\n",
    "  - Redundant condition checks in `get_primes` increase the overall execution time, as the prime checking logic is executed multiple times for each number.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Clarity and Maintainability\n",

    "  - The compact structure and lack of comments hinder the readability of the code. Users unfamiliar with the logic may struggle to understand its purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Refactored Code**:\n",
    "  - The modular design allows for better organization and clarity. Each function has a single responsibility, making the code easier to follow and modify.\n",

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "The refactored code shows substantial improvements over the original implementation in several key areas:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Performance**: The execution time dropped from **0.377 seconds** to **0.007844 seconds** due to the implementation of a more efficient prime-checking algorithm.\n",
    "2. **Code Quality**: Improved naming conventions and modular structure lead to clearer, more maintainable code.\n",
    "3. **Overall Efficiency**: The optimization in logic and structure enables the refactored code to handle larger datasets with greater speed and less computational overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "By focusing on these aspects, the refactored code not only performs better but also provides a more robust framework for future enhancements and maintenance.\n",

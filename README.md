## Python

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and versatility. It is widely used in software engineering for tasks such as unit testing, code analysis, and automation. The `pytest` framework, used in this repository, is a popular testing tool in the Python ecosystem for writing simple and scalable test cases.

## Git

Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes to files and allows multiple people to collaborate on a project. It enables users to manage and coordinate changes to the source code, ensuring that different versions of the code are maintained efficiently. Key operations include creating repositories, committing changes, and pushing to remote repositories.

## Experiments

### 1. Unit Testing with pytest

**Description:**  
This experiment focuses on writing and executing unit tests for Python functions using the pytest framework. You will cover various test cases and assertions to ensure the correctness and reliability of your code.

### 2. Version Control with Git

**Description:**  
This experiment involves practicing basic Git operations such as repository creation, file addition, committing changes, and pushing to a remote repository. It helps in understanding version control fundamentals and collaborative workflows.

## Additional Resources

- **Detailed Documentation:** A Word document explaining each command and step used in the experiments.
- **Output Document:** A document showcasing the output and results from the experiments.

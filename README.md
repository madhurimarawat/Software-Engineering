## Python

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and versatility. It is widely used in software engineering for tasks such as unit testing, code analysis, and automation. The `pytest` framework, used in this repository, is a popular testing tool in the Python ecosystem for writing simple and scalable test cases.

**pytest**  
`pytest` is a Python-based testing framework that simplifies writing small to complex test cases. It supports the development of unit tests by providing mechanisms for writing assertions, handling test fixtures, and generating test reports. Its ability to scale from simple functions to complex applications makes it ideal for ensuring code reliability and correctness.

**Git**  
Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes to files and allows multiple people to collaborate on a project. It enables users to manage and coordinate changes to the source code, ensuring that different versions of the code are maintained efficiently. Key operations include creating repositories, committing changes, and pushing to remote repositories.


**Sphinx and MkDocs**  
Sphinx and MkDocs are documentation generation tools designed to convert Python code comments (docstrings) into rich, accessible HTML documentation. Sphinx supports automatic API documentation and extensive formatting features, while MkDocs emphasizes simplicity and markdown-based writing. Both tools are used to create well-organized and professional documentation for software projects.

**unittest.mock**  
The `unittest.mock` module in Python allows for replacing parts of a system under test with mock objects to simulate real-world behaviors. This technique is useful in unit testing when isolating the function under test by removing dependencies on external components or systems, ensuring that tests remain focused and independent.

**dependency-injector**  
`dependency-injector` is a Python framework for implementing dependency injection, a design pattern that decouples the creation of dependencies from their usage. By injecting dependencies into objects rather than hard-coding them, this technique promotes flexibility, testability, and modularity in software design.

**GitHub Actions / Travis CI**  
GitHub Actions and Travis CI are continuous integration (CI) tools that automate the building and testing of code whenever changes are pushed to a repository. CI pipelines ensure that code quality is maintained by running tests automatically after each commit, allowing teams to detect and fix errors early in the development process.

## Experiments

### 1. Unit Testing with pytest

**Description:** This experiment focuses on writing and executing unit tests for Python functions using the pytest framework. You will cover various test cases and assertions to ensure the correctness and reliability of your code.

### 2. Version Control with Git

**Description:** This experiment involves practicing basic Git operations such as repository creation, file addition, committing changes, and pushing to a remote repository. It helps in understanding version control fundamentals and collaborative workflows.

### 3. Code Documentation Practice

**Description:** Write Python function and class docstrings to document code functionality. Students will then generate HTML documentation using tools like Sphinx or MkDocs. This exercise stresses the importance of maintaining clear and accessible code documentation.

### 4. Mocking

**Description:** Practice the technique of mocking in Python using libraries such as `unittest.mock`. Students will isolate and test individual components of a software system by replacing dependencies with mock objects, simulating real components in a controlled environment.

### 5. Dependency Injection

**Description:** Explore the concept of dependency injection using libraries like `dependency-injector`. This technique enables students to write flexible and testable code by decoupling the components from their dependencies, allowing easier integration and testing.

### 6. Continuous Integration Setup

**Description:** Set up a basic continuous integration (CI) pipeline using tools like GitHub Actions or Travis CI. The CI pipeline will automatically build and test code changes upon each commit, promoting best practices in automation and team collaboration.
